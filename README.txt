STAHI: Slack To AnswerHub Integration
#####################################

This is an integration using SLACK's bots and Event Subscription API to post slack messages marked with specific 'reations' to the company's ANSWERHUB page either as a new question or an answer to the previous question.

A bot-making tutorial was used as a starting place but the key functionality wasstripped and replaced with the current implementation.
